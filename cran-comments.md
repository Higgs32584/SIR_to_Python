## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In response to the initial submission comments I have:

* written the package name in single quotes in the DESCRIPTION file
* changed the Vignette title to 'shinySIR: Interactive plotting for infectious disease models'
 
 
## Test environments

* OS X High Sierra 10.13.6 local install, R 3.5.3
* OS X High Sierra 10.13.6, R 3.6.1 (on Travis CI)
* Ubuntu 16.04.6, R 3.6.1 (on Travis CI)
* win-builder (devel and release and oldrelease)
* rhub (Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS, R-release, GCC, Fedora Linux, R-devel, clang, gfortran, Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, R-devel, 32/64 bit)


## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was one NOTE on win_builder and rhub:

Maintainer: 'Sinead E. Morris <sinead.morris@columbia.edu>'

New submission

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Bjornstad (12:619)
  ODEs (12:319)
  Rohani (12:575)
  shinySIR (12:286)
  
Response: 'Bjornstad' and 'Rohani' are author surnames; 'ODEs' is an abbreviation for ordinary differential equations (explained earlier in the Description heading); and 'shinySIR' is the package name.


## Downstream dependencies
