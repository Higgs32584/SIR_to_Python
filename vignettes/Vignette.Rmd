`shinySIR` provides interactive plotting for mathematical models of infectious disease spread. Users can choose from a variety of common built-in ODE models (such as the SIR, SIRS, and SIS models), or create their own. The package is a useful teaching tool as students can visualize how changing different parameters can impact model dynamics, with minimal knowledge of coding in R. Models are inspired by those featured in the references below [1-3]; code for the original SIR example was inspired by [3].


## Basic information

###### Author and maintainer

Sinead E Morris

###### Citing this package

Citation information can be found with `citation("shinySIR")`.

###### Getting help

If you encounter any bugs related to this package please contact the author directly. Additional descriptions of the mathematical theory and package functionality can be found in the vignette. Further details on the mathematical theory can also be found in the references listed below [1-3].


## Quick start example

To install the package from Github, first install and load `devtools`, then install `shinySIR` as follows

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")

install_github("SineadMorris/shinySIR")

```


To create an interactive plot of the SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model simply load the package and use the `run_shiny()` command. A window, similar to the one below, will appear. This shows the dynamics of the SIR model at the default parameter starting values; you can then change these values to explore their impact on model dynamics.

```{r SIR, eval = FALSE}
library(shinySIR)

run_shiny(model = "SIR")

```

## Model specification

A number of common models are supplied with the package, including the SIR, SIRS, and SIS models. These can be accessed using the `model` argument, as shown above for the SIR model. These built-in models are parameterized using $R_0$ and the infectious period ($1/\gamma$), since these may be more intuitive for new students than the slightly abstract transmission rate ($\beta$) and recovery rate ($\gamma$). The values for $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are calculated from the other parameters and printed in a table below the graph (as shown in the SIR example above). A comprehensive description of all built-in models is given below. 

#### Example of user-defined model

Users can also specify their own models using the `neweqns` argument. `neweqns` takes a function containing the equations for the new model, with syntax as outlined in the example below. Note the syntax follows that used by the popular ODE solver `deSolve`.


```{r mymodel, eval = FALSE}
mySIRS <- function(t, y, parms) {

    with(as.list(c(y, parms)),{

        # Change in Susceptibles
        dS <- - beta * S * I + delta * R

        # Change in Infecteds
        dI <- beta * S * I - gamma * I

        # Change in Recovereds
        dR <- gamma * I - delta * R

    return(list(c(dS, dI, dR)))
    })
}

```

The interactive plot can then be created by calling this function with `neweqns`, and specifying vectors for the parameter attributes, including parameter starting values (`parm0`), names to be displayed in the interactive menu (`parm_names`), and minimum and maximum values for the interactive menu (`parm_min` and `parm_max`, respectively).

```{r mymodel_run, eval = FALSE}

run_shiny(model = "SIRS (w/out demography)", neweqns = mySIRS,
           parm0 = c(beta = 5e-5, gamma = 1/7, delta = 0.1),
           parm_names = c("Transmission rate", "Recovery rate", "Loss of immunity"),
           parm_min = c(beta = 1e-5, gamma = 1/21, delta = 1/365),
           parm_max = c(beta = 9e-5, gamma = 1 , delta = 1))

```

## Built-in models

Interactive plots can be generated for all built-in models using the `run_shiny()` function with the `model` argument. Starting parameters and parameter ranges will be specified by default, but these can be modified if desired.

### SIR

`model = SIR`

The simple SIR model (without births or deaths) is given by 

$$\begin{align*}
\frac{dS}{dt} &= -\beta S I\\
\frac{dI}{dt} &= \beta S I - \gamma I\\
\frac{dR}{dt} &=  \gamma I.
\end{align*}$$


where $S, I$, and $R$, are the numbers of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals in the population. Suppose the unit of time we are considering is days, then

* $\beta$ is the transmission rate and $\beta S I$ represents the number of susceptible individuals that become infected per day;
* $\gamma$ is the recovery rate and $\gamma I$ is the number of infected individuals that recover per day;
* $1\gamma$ is the infectious period i.e. the average duration of time an individual remains infected.

An important quantity of any disease model is the the reproductive number, $R_0$, which represents the average number of secondary infections generated from one infectious individual in a completely susceptible population. For the SIR model, 

$$R_0 = \beta N / \gamma, $$
where $N = S + I + R$ is the total (constant) population size.

To run the SIR model, $R_0$ and the infectious period are more intuitive parameters, we use these as inputs for the built-in SIR model


#### SIR with demography

`model = SIRbirths`

$$\begin{align*}
\frac{dS}{dt} &= \mu N -\beta S I - \mu S\\
\frac{dI}{dt} &= \beta S I - \gamma I - \mu I\\
\frac{dR}{dt} &=  \gamma I - \mu R.
\end{align*}$$


#### SIR with vaccination at birth

`model = SIRvaccination`

$$\begin{align*}
\frac{dS}{dt} &= \mu N (1 - p) -\beta S I - \mu S\\
\frac{dI}{dt} &= \beta S I - \gamma I - \mu I\\
\frac{dR}{dt} &=  \gamma I - \mu R + \mu N p.
\end{align*}$$
